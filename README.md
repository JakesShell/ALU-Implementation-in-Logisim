# ALU-Implementation-in-Logisim

<h1><b>Overview</b></h1>

This repository presents a comprehensive implementation of a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Logisim, an interactive tool designed for digital logic design. The project is methodically divided into three distinct phases, each building upon the previous one to enhance understanding and functionality.
